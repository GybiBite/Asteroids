<h2 id="what-is-this-project-about-">What is this project about?</h2>
<p>This is my own attempt at recreating the popular Atari game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game">Asteroids</a>) in Java, using the <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">LibGDX</a> library. There&#39;s no particular reason for making this project outside of just a hobby I like to do. It&#39;s pretty much just to practice for my Java skills.</p>
<h2 id="when-will-asteroids-be-finished-">When will Asteroids be finished?</h2>
<p>I have no set completion date for the project. This is primarily just a hobby, and I try to work on it whenever I have time to, just for fun.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-try-playing-it-">Can I try playing it?</h2>
<p>Sure! In addition, I&#39;d also love feedback on it, however at the time of writing this, the game is nowhere near complete. It has what I&#39;d consider the smallest amount of functionality to be considered playable. You&#39;re still welcome to try it out in the releases section!</p>
<h3 id="controls-">Controls:</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Move forward: W or UP</li>

   <li>Rotate counter-clockwise: A or LEFT</li>
   <li>Fire: Left-click (MOUSE1)</li>
   <li>
      Stop moving (only in debug mode): S or DOWN
      <h3 id="flags-">Flags:</h3>
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>-v</code>: Debug mode (shows hitboxes, logs all entities in console, allows &quot;stop moving&quot; key)
      <h2 id="how-can-i-provide-feedback-about-the-project-">How can I provide feedback about the project?</h2>
