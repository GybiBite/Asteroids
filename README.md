## What is this project about?

This is my attempt at recreating the popular Atari game [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) in Java, using the [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) library. There is no reason for making this project outside of just a hobby I like to do. It is pretty much just to practice my Java skills.

## When will Asteroids be finished?

I have no set completion date for the project. This is primarily just a hobby, and I try to work on it whenever I have time, just for fun.

## Can I try playing it?

Sure! Also, I would love feedback on it, however, at the time of writing this, the game is nowhere near complete. It has what I would consider the smallest amount of functionality to be considered playable. You're still welcome to try it out in the releases section!

### Controls:

*   Move forward: W or UP
*   Rotate clockwise: D or RIGHT
*   Rotate counterclockwise: A or LEFT
*   Fire: Left click (MOUSE1)
*   Stop moving (only in debug mode): S or DOWN

### Flags:

*   `-v`: Debug mode (shows hitboxes, logs all entities in console, allows "stop moving" key)

## How can I provide feedback about the project?

If you simply found a weird bug or something does not seem quite right, make a ticket in the [Issues](https://github.com/GybiBite/Asteroids/issues) tab. If you have other feedback or suggestions for the project, you can contact me via email at [ddemarco03@outlook.com](mailto:ddemarco03@outlook.com). I usually respond quite fast, and always open to suggestions.
